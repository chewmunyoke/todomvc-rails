# TodoMVC on Rails

The original [TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) project has provided examples on many popular MV* frameworks, but the Ruby on Rails framework is not included in their list of examples as it is not a JavaScript framework. 

This is just a demo web application using Ruby on Rails whilst using the original CSS file by TodoMVC.

## Version

* [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby) v2.4.3
* [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) v5.1.5
